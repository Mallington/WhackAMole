# WhackAMole
Created for CompSci HW. Very rudimentary, but so was the task.
Here is a bried definiton of the program as quoted from my report: "Whack-A-Mole[1] is a simple arcade game where typically the user would have some form of hammer, and would have to whack moles as they appear from a series of holes. The moles would appear from the holes at random times in random locations, and the player would have to hit them all, their score increasing with each successful hit. In our implementation of this game, there are 3 LED lights to represent the moles, and a single button to whack the moles. Thereâ€™s also a white LED to show when the user has successfully gained a point."
